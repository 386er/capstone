    "### Domain Background (Cyber Security / Intrusion Detection) \n",
    " \n",
    "With an ever growing number of connected devices, more and more traffic is transferred over networks, generating a confusing amount of log data that has to be monitored. Given this development, manual monitoring becomes increasingly infeasable to prevent cyber attacks. Network Intrusion Detections Systems (NIDS) can help system administrators to detect network breaches, however setting up policies that are both flexible and effectice against unforseen attacks can be challenging. Applying machine learning in the analysis of log file datasets can help to improve NIDS and thus strengthening the security posture of organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am working for a an IT-Consulting company with a wide range of expertise, one of which is cyber security. However the application of machine learning to cyber security topics was of little relevance so far in our daily work. Doing this project, I would like to promote ML techniques within my company for potential future projects.\n",

    "### Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of network connections between a source and target IP, each of which is represented by a total of 41 features, the problem is to predict whether a connection represents an attempt to attack the source network and to correctly predict the type of attack. The suggested solution is to model the network traffic as a time series by applying a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. Whether connections were correctly labeled can be clearly observed and by setting a random seed the problem can be reproduced.\n",

    "### Dataset and inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for the capstone project will be the KDD Cup 1999 Data, which was prepared for the Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition.  The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between 'bad' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and 'good' normal connections\n",
    "It was downloaded from <a href=\"http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html\">this</a> site. \n",
    " \n",
    "The KDD dataset was created by collecting raw TCP dump data from a simulated U.S. airforce local-area network in the course of 9 weeks. During the data collection the network was deliberately attacked multiple times. Each datapoint represents a connection between a source and target IP, using a well defined protocol, during a well defined time frame. Each datapoint is made up of 41 features and is labeled either as a normal connections or as an attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features are directly derived from the TCP/IP connections during a time interval, however the dataset includes also \"higher-level\" features that were derived from some of the basic features of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **'basic' ** set of features include inputs like duration of the connection (in seconds), the protocol type, the number of bytes from the source to the destination and vice versa. \n",
    "- The ** 'higher-level' ** features include inputs like the number of connections to the same host as the current connecton in the past two seconds, number of connection that use the same service, number of failed login attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a total of 38 types of attacks, grouped into 4 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *DOS* (denial of service) e.g. syn flood\n",
    "- *R2L* (unauthorized access from a remote machine) e.g. guessing password\n",
    "- *U2R* (unauthorized access to local superuser privileges)  e.g. various 'buffer overflow' attacks\n",
    "- *PROBING* (surveillance and other probing) e.g. port scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of the attack types that occur in the test set, occur in the training set. This is a specific characteristic of the dataset to make it more realistic. However it is believed, that most of the novel attacks can be derived from the known attacks (see Tavallee, 2009). All types of attacks will be labeled as one of the categories they are grouped in. \n",

    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the aim of maintaining reproducability, the solution will be entirely implemented using a python notebook. In order to appropriately classify malicious connections, a recurrent neural network - LSTM implementation will be calibrated and applied. The model implementation will be entirely written in the Tensorflow 1.0.0 python library.  As needed for data preparation, exploration or visualisation, additional libraries will be applied such as numpy, sklearn or matplotlib. Once the basic model setup is implemented, the model will be improved by experimenting with hyperparameter optimization, regularization techniques and feature selection. The models performance will be measured by how well it is able to correclty classifiy different kinds of attack types in comparison to the winner model of the 1999 KDD competition.\n",
